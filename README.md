There is a lot of misconception between statistical model and machine learning model. In an attempt to understand the difference, I decided to use the same wine data to generate both models as Linear Regression and check the difference between them. 

I will pinpoint the main differences between the two models, then elaborate on each model by itself.

3- Type of Data
Machine learning does really well with a wide (high number of attributes) and deep (high number of observations). However statistical modeling is generally applied for smaller data with fewer attributes or they end up overfitting.


5- Aim
The ML Linear Regression model is designed to make the most accurate prediction possible of y. While the statistical Linear Regression model is designed for inference about the relationships between y and x.
Statistical models are mainly used for research purposes, while ML models are optimal for implementation in the production environment.
