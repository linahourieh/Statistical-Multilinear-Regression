There is a lot of misconception between statistical model and machine learning model. In an attempt to understand the difference, I decided to use the same wine data to generate both models as Linear Regression and check the difference between them. 

I will pinpoint the main differences between the two models, then elaborate on each model by itself.


1- Origin

Statistical models began evolving in the 18th century in response to the novel needs of industrializing sovereign states. It started with collecting information about the states, particularly demographics such as population. Later, this extended to include all collections of information of all types including the analysis and interpretation of such data.

Machine learning is a very recent development. It came into existence in the 1990s as steady advances in digitization and cheap computing power enabled data scientists to stop building finished models and instead train computers to do so.
